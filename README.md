this is what to use when you want tabs on your page. there are 2 versions in the folder:
- buttons.html
- checkbox.html

before i tell you what the files are, this doesnt actually have 'tabs' per se, more of buttons (or checkboxes) that reveal a certain thing.
you can add as much as you want, just remember to edit the javascript.<br><br>

without further ado, here is what the files are.<br>
they are simply the type of things you want. i.e. buttons.html has buttons which reveal the content, whiile checkbox.html has boxes you can check and uncheck to show and hide the
content.
